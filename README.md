Race For Resilience - Tokyo
Our project can be found here:

This is an FM radio transmitter for the Tokyo Race for Resilience two day hackathon held February 8th and 9th, 2014.

Our group proposed an ultra low cost community FM radio broadcasting system to inform citizens of critical information
in the wake of disasters ocuring in their area. The radio will only transmit less than 10 kilometers, making it ideal
for disiminating information to a localized area.

The radio station can be managed by an individual, or the local relief center.

The transmitter is battery powered (with an optional plug to allow charging, or direct power). In addition, a smart
phone may be connected to the audio input of the transmitter.

On the smart phone, content may be generated via recording tools prepared by the team. These tools allow for easy
recording of voice, simple editing and cutting, and playlist organization.

In addition, a web site will provide localized content in the form of downloadable content packages which cover common
informative needs.

The user need only download and create a playlist. It will then be set to repeat without interruption. By pausing the
playlist, the user can record and edit new content, such as an important announcement, or conference. The user can
then include this new content and restart the playlist.


This circuit board design is free to use. Download the Eagle files and mod as you see fit.
Design is based on: http://www.wiringcircuit.com/radio/4W_FM_Transmitter_2948.html

Planned improvements include:
* 12Volt 2-3Amp battery pack and charger
* Audio Mixer
* Microphone feed to smartphone mic input or direct transmit
* Digital tuner would be nice, but only a dream ;)
